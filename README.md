# 📄 Resume Parser & Skill Extractor

An interactive **Resume Parser** built with **Python 🐍** that extracts **technical skills, experience, and company details** from resumes.  
This project helps recruiters and HR teams analyze candidate profiles efficiently by identifying their **skills, roles, and companies worked at**, with structured outputs ready for automation or further analysis.

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Extracts **technical skills** like Python, Java, SQL, Flask, Git, Machine Learning, etc.
- ✅ Counts **frequency of skills** across multiple resumes
- ✅ Detects if a candidate has a **specific skill**
- ✅ Checks if a candidate has **worked at a specific company**
- ✅ Provides **JSON-like output** for easy integration with other tools or dashboards
- ✅ Interactive: Users can modify the script to search for any skill or company dynamically

## 🚀 Getting Started

# Clone the repository
[GIT REPO CLONE](https://github.com/Prabhakarrayal/Automated-resume-parser/blob/main/Automated_resume_parser.ipynb), [COLAB CLONE](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SUy9xMNNpJdiuXDkIlEgLQ15X1_jkQS2?usp=sharing)

        cd resume-parser

# Install required Python packages
        pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the parser
        python main.py

## 🛠 How It Works

The parser reads resumes (PDF or DOCX), extracts text, and identifies **technical skills and experience**. The results are stored in a structured dictionary like this:

        result = {
            "skills": {
                "technical": ["Python", "Java", "SQL", "Flask", "Git", "Machine Learning"]
            },
            "experience": [
                {"company": "Google", "role": "Software Intern"},
                {"company": "Infosys", "role": "Developer"}
            ]
        }

This allows you to see **exactly what skills the candidate has** and their previous **job experience**, all in a structured format.

## 🎯 Customizing Searches

You can easily customize the parser to search for any skill or company:

# Search for a Skill
        search_skill = 'Python'  # Change to any skill like 'AWS', 'Java', etc.

# Search for a Company
        company_search = 'Google'  # Change to any company like 'Amazon', 'Infosys', etc.

The parser will output whether the candidate has the skill or company experience.

## 📊 Example Output

            ✅ Candidate has technical skill: Python  
            ❌ Candidate has not worked at Google  

            Total resumes processed: 1  

📊 **Technical Skills Frequency:**  

        Python: 1  
        Java: 1  
        SQL: 1  
        Flask: 1  
        Git: 1  
        Machine Learning: 1

## 📌 Future Enhancements

 🔹 Add **NER (Named Entity Recognition)** for more accurate company and role detection  
 🔹 Support multiple resume formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)  
 🔹 Build a **web interface** for uploading resumes and viewing results  
 🔹 **Database integration** for storing parsed results and analytics  
 🔹 Generate **visual dashboards** for skill distributions across multiple resumes
